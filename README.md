# Wittr

This is a silly little demo app for learning how to build an offline-first web app.
This is just a clone of this [app](https://github.com/jakearchibald/wittr)

We learned about:

- Using Service Workers to intercept network traffic. We will understand this using the ServiceWorker dev tools.
- Using the IndexedDB API (the browser database), along with Service Workers, to write caching solutions that will make your applications more performant.

## Difference between an Offline-first and Online first app

**offline first**

- Getting as many things as possible on the screen first using stuff already on the user's device in caches and such. We might still go to the network but we are not going to wait for it. We get stuff from the cache as much as we can then we can finally update the page if we finally get stuff from the network.
- If we get stuff from the network, we can update what the user is looking at and also save that data into the cache for next time.
- If we can get stuff from the network we stick with what we have got. I could be out of stale data or not. This is way better than showing nothing üòÅ
- This approach works well for good connectivity, offline apps and as well as poor connectivity(lie-fie).
- Showing an error page from a cache is not offline first

**Online first**

- Is basically trying the network first and if that fails, then we can serve some cached data or so. This works great for good connectivity and offline apps

## Service Worker Dev Tools

- In Chrome dev tools, you can find the `Service Workers` under the **Application tab** > **Application section in the side panel on the left** It has the gearbox icon on it
- With the nature of service workers, you can check the **update on reload** checkbox if you want the service worker to be more developer friendly instead of user friendly if you want to see all recent css, or js changes on your site right away. If not it will be added to the waiting sw queue and not load the new updates until
  - navigate to a page or website not controlled by that service worker and navigate back to the pervious page controlled by the service worker
  - or you close that tab and open a new tab
- Once your service worker is registered, you app becomes offline first!. You can confirm this by navigating to the Network Tab and open the Throttling dropdown which is set to No Throttling by default. Then select **offline** you will see that the page loads! üòÅ I don't not matter what network you choose slow fast or custom that page loads.
- See this [doc](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-to-perform-network-throttling-in-chrome) to learn how to add custom network speeds in chrome dev tools

## Updating the sw.js file

- Anytime you update the sw.js file like adding a new response to cache or build your app make sure to change the cacheVersion `STATIC_CACHE_NAME`. In our code we already handled deleting the old cache or keeping list of cache we wants

## DownSide to using Service Worker during development on React

- When you update your scss or the updated js file code in the src folder generates without `[es-lint]` warning or errors, there is a `hot-update` GET request that is made which the sw caches and reloads your app to see the new changes; it basically bypass the cache and loads all new js files again. **hot-update** GET request only happens when you update css files and not regular js files inside the `/src` folder
- If you want to see the new changes made to the **/src** folder **make sure your js file compile without warnings or errors or else you will not get those js changes right away**. You will have to shift-refresh the page yourself and bypass the cache; like `shift` `command` `r` especially if its **an [eslint warning] error in the terminal**. The service worker caching is so good that even checking the **update on reload** checkbox in service worker dev tools does not work. That only will reload the new sw.js file updates and NOT your updates in the **/src** folders. This might be good or bad depending on ur needs. personally i don't have any problem with this
- **Another important note:** If you make a change to the sw.js file and any js file(s) in the src folder, first save all the files in the /src folder, go and shift-refresh the page then finally save the sw.js file. This step is important if you don't want to fall into **service worker registration loop**
- Sometimes in development you might run into call **service worker registration loop** üò≠üò±; just unregister the sw active and all pending sw, then delete all caches and hot refresh the page and you should be good

## Caching Response

- With the help of [**workbox-sw**](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/modules/workbox-sw/) we can do this very easily
- FYI: The reason is did not go ahead and use the global js cache function like [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers#install_and_activate_populating_your_cache) to manually cache response is because you must be specific with the urls otherwise the cache will not work. But with workbox i can use regex and write some logic to cache certain type of fetch responses
- Other caching strategies are listed and explained [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/caching-resources-during-runtime/#caching-strategies) and [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/reference/workbox-strategies/). We used **CacheFirst** strategy for this app
- You can use [additional modules](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/modules/) from the Workbox project, add in a push notification library, or remove some of the default caching logic.

## Caching the Page Skeleton

- Since react is a single page application, we can easy cache the page skeleton. React loads all the page at one when we make a request to load the js scripts, css and index.html `/` or `/index.html`
- It is important to note that you cannot cache websocket responses. Only fetch requests is what you can cache. Our witter app pretty much get posts updates from ws so if we want to show those pose offline we will have to cache those posts in indexedDB. This way when the user is offline, we load the app skeleton and the get the posts from the indexedDB

## Ignoring ES-lints

There are two mains one

- Ignoring a line

```js
console.log("this line will be ignores"); //eslint-disable-line
```

- ignoring next line

```js
// eslint-disable-next-line -- comment to self if needed
console.log("this line will be ignores");
```
